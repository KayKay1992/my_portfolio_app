Animating the hover image and animation of post render

animated the blog image
added another blog post from prismic project by creating a log post,
animated how the posts appears.


✅ 1. Animation of Post Render (Entry Animation)
This is handled in the first useEffect with ScrollTrigger and gsap.fromTo:
useEffect(() => {
  let ctx = gsap.context(() => [
    itemsRef.current.forEach((item) => {
      gsap.fromTo(
        item,
        { opacity: 0, y: 20 },
        {
          opacity: 1,
          y: 0,
          duration: 5,
          ease: "elastic.out(1,0.3)",
          scrollTrigger: {
            trigger: item,
            start: "top bottom-=100px",
            end: "bottom center",
            toggleActions: "play none none none",
          },
        }
      );
    }),
  ]);
});
What this does:
When each post (<li>) scrolls into view, it:

Fades in from opacity 0 → 1

Moves vertically from y: 20 → y: 0

Animates with a bouncy elastic effect

Triggered via GSAP's ScrollTrigger, which makes it smooth and performant during scroll

duration: 5 means it eases in slowly (could be considered long)


✅ 2. Hover Image Animation (Reveal on Hover + Follow Mouse)
This is handled in the second useEffect and the hover logic with onMouseEnter/onMouseLeave:

useEffect(() => {
  const handleMouseMove = (e: MouseEvent) => {
    const mousePos = { x: e.clientX, y: e.clientY + window.scrollY };
    const speed = Math.sqrt(Math.pow(mousePos.x - lastMousePos.current.x, 2));

    let ctx = gsap.context(() => {
      if (currentItem !== null) {
        const maxY = window.scrollY + window.innerHeight - 350;
        const maxX = window.innerWidth - 250;

        gsap.to(revealRef.current, {
          x: gsap.utils.clamp(0, maxX, mousePos.x - 110),
          y: gsap.utils.clamp(0, maxY, mousePos.y - 160),
          rotation: speed * (mousePos.x > lastMousePos.current.x ? 1 : -1),
          ease: "back.out(2)",
          duration: 1.3,
          opacity: 1,
        });
      }
      lastMousePos.current = mousePos;
    }, component);
  };

  window.addEventListener("mousemove", handleMouseMove);
  return () => window.removeEventListener("mousemove", handleMouseMove);
}, [currentItem]);


What this does:
When the user hovers on a list item, onMouseEnter(index) sets currentItem, which triggers:

The hover image (<div className="hover-reveal">) to:

Appear (opacity: 1)

Follow the cursor position with a slight offset

Rotate slightly based on cursor speed and direction

It also hides when mouse leaves the list (onMouseLeave)

✨ Summary of the 2 Actions
Action	Behavior	Tools Used
1. Post Render Animation	List items fade + bounce in as you scroll down the page	gsap.fromTo + ScrollTrigger
2. Hover Image Animation	An image appears and follows the cursor when hovering a post	gsap.to + dynamic styles + mouse events
