Integrating navbar nav_item links and footer with social media links

explaining navbar component

Here's a concise explanation in 20 lines:

1. This is a responsive React navigation component using Next.js and Prismic CMS.
2. It takes `settings` prop containing navigation data from Prismic.
3. Uses `useState` to toggle mobile menu visibility with `open` state.
4. `usePathname` tracks current route for active link styling.
5. The navbar has two main views: mobile (hidden by default) and desktop.
6. Mobile view slides in/out with transform animation when menu button is clicked.
7. `NameLogo` component renders the site name as a home link.
8. Mobile menu shows close button (MdClose) when open.
9. Navigation items are mapped from `settings.data.nav_item`.
10. Each link has an animated yellow underline effect on hover/active state.
11. Active links are highlighted using `pathname` comparison.
12. Links use `PrismicNextLink` for Prismic-optimized routing.
13. Separators (/) are shown between desktop nav items.
14. Includes a CTA button from the settings data.
15. `clsx` handles conditional class names for styling.
16. Mobile menu has ARIA attributes for accessibility.
17. Desktop menu is hidden on mobile and vice versa (md: breakpoint).
18. Animation transitions are 300ms ease-in-out.
19. The component uses semantic HTML with `<nav>` and `<ul>` elements.
20. Styled with Tailwind CSS classes for responsive layout and theming.

The code creates an accessible, animated navigation bar that works across devices, with Prismic CMS integration for content management.


explaining the footer component 

Here’s a concise 10-line explanation of your `Footer` component with inline context:

1. **Imports utilities and components** like `clsx` for class merging, Prismic client functions, and social media icons.
2. **Defines an async `Footer` component** that fetches global site settings from Prismic CMS.
3. **Wraps footer content** in a `<Bounded>` layout component styled as a footer.
4. **Displays the site name and current year**, dynamically loaded from Prismic's `settings.data.name`.
5. **Renders navigation links** stored in `settings.data.nav_item` using `PrismicNextLink` with a styled separator `/`.
6. **Checks each social media link** (GitHub, Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram) using `isFilled.link()` to ensure they exist.
7. **Renders social icons as links**, styled with hover effects (color and scale) and accessible labels.
8. **Uses `React.Fragment` with keys** to avoid unnecessary DOM wrappers and include separators conditionally.
9. **Applies responsive layout** with Tailwind classes to align footer items across screen sizes.
10. **Returns the full footer block**, neatly structured into name, navigation, and social sections.
