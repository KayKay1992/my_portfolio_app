    HELPER COMPONENT, THAT CONTROLS WIDTH AND SPACING

    We created a component folder and created a bounded component file, a reuseable wrapper component that controls content width and spacing.

    Explaining the component.

    Here's a concise 7-line explanation of the code:  

1. **Flexible Container Component**: Creates a reusable wrapper that controls content width and spacing.  
2. **Customizable Element**: Uses the `as` prop to render as any HTML element (default: `<section>`).  
3. **Responsive Padding**: Applies increasing padding (`px-4`, `md:px-6`, etc.) across breakpoints.  
4. **Max-Width Constraint**: Nests children in a centered `div` with `max-w-7xl` (1280px).  
5. **Ref Forwarding**: Supports React refs for direct DOM access.  
6. **Class Merging**: Uses `clsx` to combine default and custom Tailwind classes (`className`).  
7. **Type-Safe**: Enforces props with TypeScript (`BoundedProps`).  

Perfect for consistent page sections with responsive margins! ðŸš€

In idex.sx file we replaced section tag with bounded component remember to import it.

I installed a third party package named clsx using this command npm i clsx

what does it do?

What clsx Does (Simple Explanation)
clsx is a tiny utility (<1kB) that helps conditionally join CSS class names in React/Tailwind.

Key Features:
Merges Strings: Combines multiple class names into one string.

Handles Conditionals: Easily toggle classes based on conditions.

Removes Falsy Values: Ignores undefined, false, or null classes.

Example Without clsx (Messy)
<div className={`text-lg ${isActive ? "bg-blue-500" : ""} ${error ? "text-red-500" : ""}`} />

Example With clsx (Cleaner)
<div className={clsx(
  "text-lg",
  isActive && "bg-blue-500",
  error && "text-red-500"
)} />
