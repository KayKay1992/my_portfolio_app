ANIMATING TECH LIST


Here’s a 7-line explanation of the GSAP animation logic in your enhanced `Techlist` component:

1. The animation uses **GSAP** with the **ScrollTrigger** plugin to animate tech rows as the user scrolls.
2. A `useRef` named `component` is attached to the section to serve as the scroll trigger target.
3. Inside a `useEffect`, `gsap.context` ensures scoped animations and proper cleanup.
4. A GSAP timeline is created and linked to the scroll position using `scrub: 7`, which smooths the scroll animation.
5. Each `.tech-row` element animates its horizontal position (`x`) from a random offset (left or right) toward the opposite direction.
6. The direction of the animation alternates by index — even rows move one way, odd rows the other.
7. On component unmount, `ctx.revert()` is called to clean up the animation and avoid memory leaks.

Let me know if you want to add fade-in, stagger, or scroll-based scaling effects next!


some other animations style
1. Staggered Slide + Fade In (for tech rows)
Gives a smooth, elegant entrance with motion and opacity.

tl.from('.tech-row', {
  x: (index) => index % 2 === 0 ? 200 : -200,
  opacity: 0,
  duration: 1.2,
  ease: 'power3.out',
  stagger: 0.2, // Adds delay between each tech-row animation
});

2. Skew + Scale Entry (for dramatic reveal)
Adds a modern, cinematic flair.
tl.from('.tech-row', {
  opacity: 0,
  scale: 0.8,
  skewX: 20,
  duration: 1.5,
  ease: 'expo.out',
  stagger: 0.15,
});

3. Scroll-synced Parallax Slide
Makes the rows glide horizontally in sync with scroll position.

tl.to('.tech-row', {
  xPercent: (index) => (index % 2 === 0 ? -40 : 40),
  ease: 'none',
  scrollTrigger: {
    trigger: component.current,
    scrub: true,
    start: 'top bottom',
    end: 'bottom top',
  },
});

4. Bounce Pop-In (tech names only)
Targets .tech-item spans and adds a fun bounce effect.

ts
Copy
Edit
tl.from('.tech-item', {
  scale: 0,
  opacity: 0,
  duration: 0.6,
  ease: 'back.out(1.7)',
  stagger: {
    each: 0.03,
    grid: [slice.primary.techgroup.length, 15],
    from: 'random',
  },
});
