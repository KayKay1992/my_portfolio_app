SETTING UP THREE JS SCENE AND CREATING THE SHAPE COMPONENT.

visit react-three-fibre website.
2. Go to the introduction document 
3. Copy the installation command and install it in your project
4. back to threejs site scroll down you will find ecosysytem then another threejs component u need to insatll is the threejs drei, use this command npm install @react-three/drei
5. Because we creating the shapes and symbols in hero section, so we created a file in the hero section folder shapes.tsx.

Three.js in Your Project
Three.js is a powerful JavaScript library for creating 3D graphics in the browser using WebGL. In your project, you're using it with React via @react-three/fiber (R3F), which provides React components for Three.js objects, making it easier to work with 3D in a React environment.

10 Key Aspects of Three.js Usage in Your Project:
Canvas Setup: The <Canvas> component creates a Three.js scene, camera, and renderer

Geometry Creation: Using various Three.js geometries (Icosahedron, Capsule, etc.)

Material Application: Applying different materials to 3D objects

Animation: Using GSAP for smooth animations and transitions

Interactivity: Adding click and hover events to 3D objects

Environment Lighting: Using HDRI environment maps for realistic lighting

Effects: Adding contact shadows for depth realism

Floating Animation: Using Float from drei for hover effects

Performance: Using Suspense for lazy loading assets

Responsive Design: Camera setup that works with your layout



*****************************************************************
Documentation Recommendation
For using the Three.js documentation effectively with your project:

React Three Fiber Docs: Since you're using R3F, start with their documentation for React-specific implementations

Drei Docs: For components like Float and ContactShadows, check drei documentation

Three.js Core Docs: For understanding geometries and materials, use the main Three.js docs

Search by Class: When looking up something, search for the class name (e.g., "THREE.IcosahedronGeometry")

Examples Section: The Three.js examples section shows many practical implementations

Remember that with R3F, Three.js classes are converted to React components (e.g., <mesh> instead of new THREE.Mesh()), but the underlying concepts remain the same.

the shape component file is then used in hero index file.
